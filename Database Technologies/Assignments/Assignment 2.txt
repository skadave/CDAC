Assignment 2

1) Which field of the Customers table is the primary key?
-> Cnum is the primary key of the Customers table as it store all unique ids of customers and we can uniquely identify each customer/row in the table with it. 


2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
-> Rating column is the 4th column in Customers table.


3) What is another word for row? For column?
-> In SQL, rows are also called as 'records' and columns are also called as 'fields'. 


4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
-> Because when we insert the rows, they (file per row) are not stored in a sequential manner. They get stored at random locations in the SQL DB Server Hard Disk.
So by default, the rows are displayed in the ascending order of their 'addresses' in the Hard Disk.
